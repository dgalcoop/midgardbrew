			<p>Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.</p>
			<p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
			<p>That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.</p>
